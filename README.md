## What is Kiro? 
Kiro is an agentic IDE that helps you go from prototype to production with spec-driven development.
From simple to complex tasks, Kiro works alongside you to turn prompts into detailed specs, then into working code, docs, and tests-so what you build is exactly what you want and ready to share with your team.
Kiro's agents help you solve challenging problems and automate tasks like generating documentation and unit tests. With Kiro, you can build beyond prototypes while being in the driver's seat every step of the way.
